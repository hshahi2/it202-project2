<h1>About Us</h1>
<p>My name is Hamza Shahid, and I am the developer behind the creation of this Progressive Web App. This app lets users search for, and map Chicago's Movies in the Park for 2019. In addition, the app also lets users enter some search criteria, then view the results in both a list view as well as a map view. Users are also able to search by park name, movie title and day of the week (e.g., movies on Fridays, Saturdays or Sundays). A checkbox element is includid which let users indicate whether they only want to see upcoming movies (ignoring movies that have already occurred).</p>
